Prashant Gupta,5,Best iPhone upgrade after the iPhone 14. I got this in Big Billion Day Sale for 53k. I'm reviewing this phone after 3 months.The Camera and display quality is amazing. But I switched from a 120 Hz display android phone so it took me a while to adapt to this one.But looking at a overall scenario it is a decent phone with clean UI. I've been liking iOS now and will definitely upgrade to iOS in future.The battery is not upto the mark but it does the job pretty well.I liked the automations an...,0.33148148148148154,0.5518518518518518,Neutral,94

Performance user experience camera design is undoubtedly excellent the only drawback is the battery life , which sustains for only 6 7 hours and in daily life have to charge 2 times . As a flagship phone it could be a better but noting is perfect, without the battery issue in every aspect it is value for money.",0.475,0.6125,Mixed,86

One very promising I've seen so far using iPhone is that battery last longer than i expected with high security. It's like pay per view authenticity one can appreciate using iPhone.

Barsha  Karmakar,5,"I appreciate that the iPhone 15 has turned its weakest aspect, the dynamic range, into one of its strongest features. However, the 60 Hz display bothers me daily. It's not that a 60 Hz display is inherently bad, but after spending so much on a phone in 2024, not getting a smooth display experience is disappointing. This makes it the most expensive phone with a 60 Hz display. Apart from that, everything else is superb.",0.03333333333333336,0.49259259259259264,Neutral,75
